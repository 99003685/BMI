The formula for calculating the BMI, weight is divided by the square of the height. Here the weight is in kilograms and height is in meters.BMI=kg/(m)^2 | In this project we use GitHub repository to store the project and Visual Studio code for debugging the code.Some other tools are used for making the UML diagrams.

| To fulfil the requirement of finding the age by using the date of birth, this age calculator is made. | The CPP programming language is used in this entire project.

| Basal Metabolic Rate is the number of calories required to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is also known as your body&#39;s metabolism; therefore any increase to your metabolic weight such as exercise will increase your BMR.
BMR for Men: 66.47 + (13.75 \* weight [kg]) + (5.003 \* height [cm]) − (6.755 \* age [years])
BMR for Women: 655.1 + (9.563 \* weight [kg]) + (1.85 \* height[cm]) − (4.676 \* age [years]) | In this project we use GitHub repository to store the project and Visual Studio code for debugging the code.Some other tools are used for making the UML diagrams.
